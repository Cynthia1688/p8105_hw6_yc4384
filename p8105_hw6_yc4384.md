# Problem_1

This dataset records the crimes solved rate in each state - The
Washington Post has gathered data on homicides in 50 large U.S. cities.

## *Data pre-processing*

- Add a character variable `city_state` representing `city` and `state`
  variables;

- Add a binary variable `resolved` to indicate whether cases were solved
  or not;

- Limit `victim_race` to `black` and `white` people;

- Filter cities `Tulsa, AL`, `Dallas, TX`, `Phoenix, AZ`,
  `Kansas City, MO` as they contain NA values;

- Drop NAs to guarantee `victim_age` is numeric.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) |> 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    resolved = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest")
  ) |> 
  filter(victim_race %in% c("Black", "White"),
         !(city_state %in% c("Tulsa, AL", "Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO"))) |> 
  drop_na() |> 
  select(resolved, victim_age, victim_race, victim_sex, city_state)
```

## *Fitting Models*

``` r
fit_logistic = 
  homicide_df |> 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |> 
  glm(resolved ~ victim_age + victim_sex + victim_race, data = _, family = binomial()) |> 
  broom::tidy() |> 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate)) |> 
  select(term, estimate, OR)
```
